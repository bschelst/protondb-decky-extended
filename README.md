## ⚙️ What it does

ProtonDB Badges eXtended retrieves ProtonDB ratings via the ProtonDB API and overlays them as a tappable badge on each game’s library page. Tapping the badge opens the corresponding ProtonDB page.

This plugin is an actively maintained extension of the original *protondb-decky* plugin and adds a **Submit** button, allowing users to submit ProtonDB reports **directly from Game Mode**, from their library, without opening a browser.  
The submit button can be enabled or disabled in the plugin settings.

---

## ✨ Why this plugin exists

The original protondb-decky plugin is no longer maintained and has been archived. Additionally, submitting ProtonDB reports required several manual steps outside Game Mode.

This plugin was created to:
- Keep ProtonDB badges available on Steam Deck/Steam Client Picture Big mode.
- Simplify report submission.
- Allow submission to be done directly from the game page in Game Mode.
- Show badges on Steam Store page.

---

## 🛠️ Features & Options

- **Badge size**: Regular, Small, or Minimalist (icon-only)
- **Badge position**: Multiple positions around the game header. (Hero)
- **Submit button toggle**: Disable report submission if desired.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

**ProtonDB device registration**  
The first time you want to submit a report on Steam Deck, you will need to open the protondb website in order to register the Steam Deck.
This is a limitation of the protondb website, and this is only a one-time action.

**Steam Store page badges**  
Currently the badges are visible as an overlay, which doesn't look the same as the badges on the library.

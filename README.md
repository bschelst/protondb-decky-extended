Display tappable ProtonDB badges on your game pages, extended edition.

## How it works

This plugin retrieves ProtonDB ratings from the ProtonDB API and overlays a tappable badge on the game page. Tapping the badge opens the corresponding ProtonDB page for the game.
This is an update to the protondb-decky plugin, extending it with a Submit button. It allows users to submit a report directly from their library.
The new submit button can be disabled in the settings.

## Why was the eXtended plugin created

I really like the protondb-decky plugin and consider it a must-have on my Steam Deck.
Recently, I noticed that the plugin is no longer maintained and has been archived. At the same time, I found the process of submitting ProtonDB reports rather cumbersome—opening a browser, searching for the game, and so on.
I wanted a more straightforward approach: the ability to submit a report directly from the game itself, with a simple button.

## Options

### Size
Choose between Regular, Small, and Minimalist (No text)

### Position
Place the badge around different corners of the game page header.

### Disable Submit
If you don't want to submit reports, you can disable the submit badge.


## Limitations

**Store Pages:** ProtonDB badges are currently **not supported on Steam store pages** due to Steam's security architecture. Store pages run in an isolated browsing context that cannot be accessed by Decky plugins. Badges work on **library game pages only**.

## Translations

Translations were changed/added using AI, beause I don't speak all those languages. If something is wrong, please let me know.

## Support

The plugin was tested on:
 - SteamOS 3.9 - Decky Loader v.3.2.1 - SteamClient023 - Steam Deck LCD. 
 - Ubuntu 25.10- Decky Loader v.3.2.1 - SteamClient023 
 - Bazitte 43 - Nvidia version - Decky Loader v.3.2.1 - SteamClient023 

As I don't have a Steam Deck OLED, I'm afraid I cannot test it on Steam Deck OLED. If that's a must, you can sponsor me ;)

## How it works

This plugin will grab ProtonDB ratings from the ProtonDB API and overlay a tappable badge on the game page. Tapping the badge takes you to the ProtonDB page for the game.

## Options

### Size
Choose between Regular, Small, and Minimalist (No text)

### Position
Place the badge around different corners of the game page header.

## Decky Loader

This plugin requires [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader).
